# SharePoint-ClientId-Secret-Authentication (SharePoint Online)

SharePoint Online Azure Access Control (ACS) Authentication. How to get AppOnlyAccessToken?

## How to register an app?

- Go to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite/_layouts/appregnew.aspx
- Register ClientID and Secret
- Domain and redirect URI does not matter when we use the secret
- Go to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite/_layouts/appinv.aspx
- Paste the client ID and click the lookup button
- In the `Permission Request XML` input add:
```xml
<AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
    <AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection" Right="FullControl" />
</AppPermissionRequests>
```
- Scope of `http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection` means site collection level of permissions. 
- The `http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection` must remain as is. This is not a real tenant SharePoint url.
- Rights can be FullControl, Manage, Write, Read.
- Give the minimum rights needed
- Click the create button
- You must see this window

- Trust it.
- To verify that Is trusted go to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite/_layouts/appprincipals.aspx and see if it is listed
 

## How to get the AppOnlyAccessToken token?

It is single HTTP request:

```
POST:

https://accounts.accesscontrol.windows.net/contoso.onmicrosoft.com/tokens/OAuth/2

HEADERS:

content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded

FORM DATA (URLSearchParams fromat):

grant_type=client_credentials

&resource=00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000/contoso.sharepoint.com@contoso.onmicrosoft.com

&client_id=0cc5eb23-ec9e-4dee-937b-b0fd4b5994a8@contoso.onmicrosoft.com

&client_secret=uYDy8GEfw/CCDr2BBTitoRuedsGa7veIKTW2W7ZSMT8=

&scope=00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000/contoso.sharepoint.com@contoso.onmicrosoft.com

```

#### Additional Notes:
- 00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000 â€“ never changes. This is Office 365 guid
- **You have to replace contoso.onmicrosoft.com with other tenant ID** where is present to make it work for other tenants. **INCLUDING the post request URL**.
- **You have to replace contoso.sharepoint.com with <OTHER_TENANT>.sharepoint.com** where is present to make it work for other tenants
- Client ID appends the tenant ID separated by @. You might easily miss it.
- The Secrets have expiry by default expiration is 1 year. You will then have to generate new app.
